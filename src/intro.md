# Introduction

Styles are the conventions that govern our code. The term style is a bit of a
misnomer, since these conventions cover far more than just source file
formattingâ€”gofmt handles that for us.

The goal of this guide is to manage this complexity by describing in detail the
Dos and Don'ts of writing Go code. These rules exist to keep the code
base manageable while still allowing engineers to use Go language features
productively.
